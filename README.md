# Diagnosing Mental Health

# 1. Background

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) is a framework developed by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that aims to describe functioning across several psychological domains and neurobiological levels of analysis. To a degree, the domains and techniques specified by the RDoC matrix reflect current research priorities and may influence the scope of planned research programs. The RDoC matrix originally included five domains: (1) negative and (2) positive valence; (3) cognitive systems; (4) social processes; and (5) arousal and regulatory systems. In January 2019, a sixth sensorimotor systems domain focusing on motor control and learning was added to the RDoC.


The overarching objective of this project is to provide a testbed for exploring the supposition that adding motor and sensory domains to the original RDoC Domains better captures heterogeneity within a mental health disorder. We also aim to test the relative descriptive success of these domains separately (motor; sensory; original RDoC) as well as combined.
